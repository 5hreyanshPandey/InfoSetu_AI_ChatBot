# InfoSetu_AI_ChatBot_with_Voiceflow
This project develops an AI-powered chatbot for the Department of Justice (DoJ) website, assisting users with queries related to courts, judiciary data, and legal services. The chatbot is built using Voiceflow and the GPT-4 API, enabling it to handle tasks like document summarization, case details lookup, and petition filing guidance.
The project is divided into two main parts:

1. AI Chatbot Development
This part contains the files and resources related to the development of the AI chatbot.
The chatbot itself is built using:
Voiceflow: A visual chatbot development platform that enables conversational flows.
GPT-4 API: For handling intelligent responses based on natural language understanding.
The chatbot can answer queries related to:
Judiciary processes
Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections
Filing petitions
Accessing court details and services
How to Run
Run the AI Chatbot:

If you're working with the chatbot in the Voiceflow environment, open the chatbot_flow.voiceflow file within the Voiceflow platform to view and test the conversational flows.
For the GPT-4 integration, the gpt4_integration.py script handles communication with the AI, responding to queries.

2. Integration with DoJ Website
This part contains files showing how the chatbot is integrated into the Department of Judiciary website.
Inside the folder named doj.gov.in, you will find an index.html file that serves as the starting point for viewing the chatbot in action on the official website.
The index.html file includes the chatbot interface embedded into a webpage, demonstrating how it will work within the DoJ web environment.
 How To Run
View Chatbot on the Website:
To see how the chatbot works on the DoJ website, open the doj.gov.in/index.html file in a web browser. This will display the chatbot as it would appear when integrated into the Department of Judiciary website.
